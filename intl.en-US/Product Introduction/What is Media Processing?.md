# What is Media Processing? {#concept_nch_v33_w2b .concept}

Media Processing \(ApsaraVideo Media Processing, formerly MTS\) is a multimedia data processing service. It offers a highly elastic, and scalable yet user-friendly, and economic method to convert your audio and video files stored on OSS into the formats compatible with PCs, TVs, or handheld devices. MPS performs multi-modal analysis on the content, characters, scenarios of the audio or video on the basis of an in-depth research conducted on the mass data. This helps to achieve intelligent detection and editing, and content understanding.

Media Processing \(MPS\) is built based on Alibaba Cloud computing platform. Earlier, users had to make huge investments to buy, build, and manage transcoding software and hardware. Along with this, users also had to perform multiple complex configurations, transcoding parameter adaptation, and various other operations. MPS has transformed all this.

Cloud computing services are elastically scalable and therefore are capable of satisfying business transcoding demands. Additionally, it avoids wastage of resources.

MPS provides the functions including the Web management console, service APIs, and SDKs. These functions allow you to use and manage transcoding service, and integrate transcoding functions into your own apps and services.
