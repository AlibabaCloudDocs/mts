The benefits of MPS in video transcoding and intelligent auditing are as follows.

## Video transcoding {#section_yyg_hhp_w2b .section}

|Benefits|Alibaba Cloud Media Processing|Self-built transcoding|
|:-------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------|
|High cost-effectiveness| -   No need for upfront investment, payment only necessary for what you actually use.
-   Narrowband HDTM and H. 265 technology, smaller file sizes and less traffic for equivalent quality videos.

 |Requires a large reserve of transcoding resources, high maintenance costs.|
|Powerful transcoding capabilities|High-speed and stable parallel transcoding system, dynamically adjust transcoding resources as needed, automatic scaling, seamlessly scales out cluster resources to respond to high-concurrency transcoding needs.|Difficult to support large-scale, highly concurrent transcoding tasks.|
|Specialized transcoding algorithms|Powerful computing resources, advanced video processing algorithms, unique image quality restoration technology, reconstructs normal or corrupted video content to create ultra HD or digitally restored versions.|Video quality relies on the open-source transcoding service.|
|Rich functions, highly customizable| -   Provides video transcoding, screenshots, watermarks, video cutting, splicing, and many other media processing functions to meet the needs of various scenarios.
-   Highly scalable media transcoding templates and support for custom transcoding parameters to meet diverse transcoding needs.

 |Requires self-built access to open-source transcoding services and the construction of a transcoding service from the ground up.|
|Easy-to-use media workflows|Custom media workflows, automatically triggers media workflow transcoding upon upload completion, a messaging function provides real-time status updates, a normal video processing flow can be constructed in one minute.|Requires self-developed transcoding interfaces and notification functions.|
