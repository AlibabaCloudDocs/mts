# Library quick start guide

A library uses OSS to store your audio and video resources. It provides media indexing function, allowing you to quickly search for audio and video resources by titles, tags, categories, and descriptions.

After MPS is activated, initialize the library and set **Input Media Bucket** and **Output Media Bucket**.

-   **Input Media Bucket**: This bucket stores the original videos you have uploaded.

-   **Output Media Bucket**: This bucket stores videos output by the Media Files.


1.  Log on to the [Media Processing console](https://mts.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.0.0.6RsosT#/mts/oss).

    The console checks the activation status of services the product depends on. Follow the operation instructions on this page.

2.  Select the region.
3.  Click **Library** \> **Library Settings** \> **Media Buckets** to set the **Input Media Bucket** and **Output Media Bucket**.

    1.  Set **Input Media Bucket**.
        1.  Click **Add** at the right side of **Input Media Bucket**.
