# Developing process of workflows {#concept_wwl_htj_z2b .concept}

1.  Set a workflow

    Easy to use: By using the GUIs of the console, a cloud-based audio/video handling process is constructed on demand.

    Powerful functions: The screenshot taking, transcoding, narrowband HD analysis, encapsulation, watermarking, and editing functions are supported.

    For more information about console configuration, see [Workflows](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Library/Workflows.md#).

2.  Upload a media file

    After a media file is uploaded to the input bucket and path specified by the workflow, the workflow is automatically executed based on the specified process.

3.  Wait for a message notification

    Message notifications during the workflow execution. For example, the execution startup and completion notifications, are received.

4.  Play a video

    After a workflow is executed, the playback URL after transcoding is obtained to play a video using a player.
